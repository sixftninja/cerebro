   - Rotating log files with size limits
   - Development console output
   - Stack trace capture for debugging

### Partially Implemented Features

1. **Workspace UI** (Reference: ```typescript:frontend/pages/workspace.tsx
startLine: 4
endLine: 196

```)
   - Basic layout implemented
   - Task creation form
   - Datasource selection interface
   - Chat interface structure
   - Missing: Actual task execution, real-time updates, canvas functionality

2. **Enterprise Configuration**
   - Basic database schema
   - Frontend form structure
   - Missing: Complete configuration workflow, validation logic

3. **Datasource Integration**
   - Basic structure defined
   - Missing: Actual integration implementations for all datasource types

4. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Error handling middleware complete
   - Logging system implemented
   - Missing: Cache management, background tasks
   - Missing: Rate limiting, advanced security features

### Not Yet Implemented

1. **Knowledge Core**
   - No implementation of knowledge graph
   - Missing vector database integration
   - No DSPy module integration
   - Missing document embedding system

2. **Agents and Task Execution**
   - No implementation of agent system
   - Missing task orchestration
   - No integration with external tools
   - Missing DSPy module implementation

3. **KnowledgeSets**
   - Database schema not defined
   - No implementation of dataset creation
   - Missing training data collection system

4. **Advanced Features**
   - No workflow visualization
   - Missing real-time collaboration features
   - No implementation of recommendation system
   - Missing integration with external APIs

## Critical Gaps

1. **Data Processing**
   - No implementation of data extraction from configured sources
   - Missing data transformation pipelines
   - No implementation of the promised semantic search capabilities

2. **Security**
   - Basic authentication only
   - Missing proper encryption
   - No implementation of enterprise-grade security features

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Missing connectors for most datasources
   - No implementation of the promised unified data access layer

## Next Steps Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Implement core Knowledge Graph functionality
   - Develop basic agent system for task execution
   - Complete datasource integration framework
   - Implement proper security measures

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Develop workflow visualization system
   - Implement KnowledgeSet creation and management
   - Add real-time collaboration features
   - Create recommendation system

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Advanced analytics features
   - Custom visualization tools
   - Advanced automation capabilities

## Technical Debt

1. **Frontend**
   - Placeholder components need proper implementation
   - Missing error handling in many components
   - Need proper state management solution
   - Missing comprehensive testing

2. **Backend**
   - Missing proper error handling (Implemented)
   - Missing logging and monitoring (Implemented)
   - Need implementation of background tasks
   - Need implementation of rate limiting
   - Need implementation of advanced security features

## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress in establishing robust backend infrastructure with comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities. While still in early stages, the implementation of these critical support services provides a solid foundation for building the core features. The current codebase represents approximately 20% of the envisioned system, with recent focus on reliability and maintainability through proper error handling and logging.

Significant development effort is still required to implement the core features that will make Cerebro a truly intelligent enterprise automation platform. The priority should be implementing the Knowledge Core and agent system, as these components are central to the platform's value proposition.
